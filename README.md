# Agentsville-trip-planner
In this project, I implement an AI system to help you plan a trip--to the wonderful city of AgentsVille!

The AI system should demonstrate advanced LLM reasoning techniques including:

1. **Role-Based Prompting** - The agent will act as a specialized travel planner
2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Step-by-step planning of itineraries
3. **ReAct Prompting** - Thought → Action → Observation cycles
4. **Feedback Loops** - Self-evaluation using tools in the ReAct loop to find mistakes and improve plans

It simulates external API calls to gather weather data and activities. Then, it processes this information to create personalized travel itineraries based on interests and other constraints. It deploys a feedback loop to refine the plan.

Overall, the task is to build a travel agent that can plan the perfect AgentsVille vacation!
